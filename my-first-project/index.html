				<h1>Rules of Squid Game!</h1>
				<p>
					Squid Game might be the most outrageous show on Netflix, but it's taking the streaming world by storm. For many viewers, the term "Squid Game" is totally new. Despite the show's very violent premise, people all over the world just can't get enough of it.
					<br>
					<br>
					But while no one would actually volunteer to play the version of these childhood games they see in the hit Korean series (at least, I hope no one would), many are still scratching their heads over how the real-life Squid Game is played. Ready to find out for yourself? Here's how Squid Game IRL works.
					<br>
					<br>
					Based on the video of Seong Gi-hun playing as a child, the kids playing defense are able to push, pull, and basically do whatever is necessary to make sure that the offense doesn't win. Of course, in the IRL version, you wouldn't really die. You would just be out of the game. But anything goes in the version that they're playing in the Netflix series!
					<br>
					<br>
					This is the biggest question that most Squid Game viewers seem to have. The rules shared in the series aren't entirely clear on how this happens, but hopefully we'll get more clarification as more people rediscover it.
